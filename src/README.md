# Preface

><br>**NOTE:** This is the first edition of the project documentation, compiled in a form of a short book. It's still *work in progress*, which means a lot of errors and unfinished pages. If you've spotted some silly error, or want to add a paragraph somewhere, you can [create an issue on github](https://github.com/theoutcome/docs/issues).<br><br>

## What does this book contain?

It contains a compilation of easy to parse documents describing the project, it's various elements and goals.

It also includes information and guides relevant to the process of creating and running simulations, as well as integrating them with other software using existing APIs.

## Who is this book intended for?

It's for anyone who wishes to understand the thought process behind the design of various elements of the project. It's for people who want to learn about how the simulations are created and run, how the models and data are handled.

It's also for anyone who doesn't want to dive into design details, but instead is interested in experimenting with already existing models and tools. It's fine to skip the chapters one may find boring or complicated - one can always revisit certain chapters as any problems come up later along the way.

## How is this book written?

Documentation for this project is meant to be easy to read and understand for anyone, whether they have prior experience with computer programming or not.

That said, first edition is not kept up to this high standard of accessibility. It still contains language and references that may be difficult to parse for people without prior experience with programming. The goal for the next editions will be to further refine the documents in this book to:
- reduce usage of highly *industry-specific* terms
- increase the number and quality of explanations where the above is not possible
- increase the number of links to external resources
- provide illustrations to make things easier to understand
