# Proof

*Proof* is the proposed way to handle running multiple simulations to figure out how the complex systems we create actually operate.

It's based the following ideas:

- complex dynamic systems don't yield consistent results, but
- restricting the length of the simulation makes for more consistent results, also
- we can run our simulation multiple times and try to spot correlations in the data
