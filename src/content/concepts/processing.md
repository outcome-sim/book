# Processing

In this chapter we will look at some of the common procedures for simulation processing.

## Common procedures as exposed by implementations

Implementations of the architecture offer a set of *functions* ("procedures") for common processing actions. This is so that they can be easily used when implementing those in yet a higher level environments (like when making a game, see [Anthropocene](../implementations/anthropocene.md)).

Most common procedures include: initial processing of the data (parsing), spawning simulation instance, processing single simulation tick, processing full simulation run, exporting and importing simulation states using snapshots, etc.


## Different approaches to processing

There are some more advanced subjects to processing, like more customized input substitution and server-based simulation.
