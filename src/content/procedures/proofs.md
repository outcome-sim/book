# Proofs

**Proof** defines a way for running multiple ([unsupervised](unsupervised.md)) simulations in a organized manner.

Running multiple simulations is done to find possible correlations for specific simulation variables' values. Simulation iterations can be created using either exactly the same starting data or using **variations** for selected data.
