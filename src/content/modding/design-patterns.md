# Design patterns

Important part of modeling of any system is good design.

Particular properties of the computation scheme for `outcome` models
requires us to think about our design in a quite specific way. We'll need to
take the time to talk about some of the important design patterns.

Patterns discussed here are mostly related to specific theme and "use case"
promoted currently by the project. In particular modeling
[anthropocene](../project-overview.md#games-and-other-applications) (game)
simulation is one of the main focuses with most of these patterns.

This list is by no means complete. Treat it more like an initial exploration of the topic.
