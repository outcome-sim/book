# Working with the command line

We've already seen some of what `outcome` CLI tooling can do for us. In the past few chapters we've used commands like `new` and `run`. We never got to explore them in more detail though. That's what we will focus on in this chapter. We will also introduce some totally new and exciting functionality.

## When in doubt, use `--help`

As with most command line tools, the `--help` flag, also available in it's shorter form `-h`, is your friend.

Additional help is available for each of the subcommands, not only the *top level* of the program. When in doubt, use the `--help` option to get a rundown of required arguments, as well as available options and flags, for any of the program subcommands.
