# Working with the command line

We've already seen some of the command line interface exposed by `outcome` CLI tooling. In the past few chapters we've used commands like `new` and `run`. We never got to explore them in more detail though. That's what we will focus on in this chapter. We will also introduce new functionality we haven't used in this book before.

We will go through the available commands and document some of the lesser known commands and options available.

## When in doubt, use `--help`

As with most command line tools, the `--help` flag, also available in it's shorter form `-h`, is your friend.

Additional help is available for each of the subcommands, not only the *top level* of the program. When in doubt, use the `--help` option to get a rundown of required arguments, as well as available options and flags, for any of the program subcommands.
